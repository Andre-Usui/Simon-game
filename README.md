# Simon-game
Hello! There my version of the Simon game using async functions.

This is a lesson from The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp from Angela Yu.
I've tryed this time makes the challenge without any help or guide from my 
teacher. By doing this, passed some more of 2 days breaking my head and learning
new things. To do the challenge as i was planned, i need to learn about promisses,
async, await and resolves. Was'nt a simple task, a challenge itself. But i'm feeling 
very proud of myself now i've learned something by myself and the Simon game is 
running perfect. 

I thought on add some features, but for now i'll keep the course. 

The features was:
 - Hard mode
   - Countdown: visible, ending, etc;
   - More buttons;
 - Random patterns(?);
   - Some of the firsts number is always same, or always differents;
   - Triggers events that some patterns are called.
 - Record spammer.
         
Someday i'll be back here to continue.
